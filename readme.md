# Query Interface

Design an interface that acts like a search bar for your log data. Users should be able to find what they need in a flash, whether it's by hunting for specific error messages, filtering by resource IDs, or diving into a particular time frame (bonus points!). Make sure the interface has some visualizations as well (after all who doesn't like some cool graphs?)
